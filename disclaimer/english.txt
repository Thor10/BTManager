<p>Please remember that:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p>*MYBT* promotes and stimulates free information exchange between people,
        without limitations of country, age, gender, civil state, race, religion, etc.</p></li>
        <li><p>*MYBT* promotes, stimulates and defends &quot;freeware&quot; and Open Source products</p></li>
        <li><p>*MYBT* retains important communication and socialization on the Internet, and promotes it</p></li>
        <li><p>*MYBT* defends the rigths of consumers, artists, software developers, minors
        and people around them</li>
        <li><p>*MYBT* does not allow illegal activities on the web site</p></li>
        <li><p>*MYBT* does not have human and technological means needed to monitor data traffic
        directly or indirectly made by using the Service</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Service is totally free and anonymous, in fact:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p>You are not required to submit any confidential data
        like name, surname, address and phone number</p></li>
        <li><p>You're not required to pay money to use the Service</p></li>
        <li><p>*MYBT* does not directly earn money when a user submits or downloads a Torrent</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Service is subject to the application of all normatives about information transmission and
publication. Particularly, the user agrees that:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p><u>It is strictly prohibited to use the Service in order to exchange child-porn material</u></p></li>
        <li><p>It is strictly prohibited to use the Service in order to exchange copyrighted material
        without a distribution license</p></li>
        <li><p>It is strictly prohibited to use the Service in order to exchange material that is
        dangerous for the Public Security (like, as examples, manuals the constructions of fire, chemical,
        bacteriological weapons or material that, in any way, may promote illegal acts like terrorism)</p></li>
        <li><p>It is strictly prohibited to use the Service for fake-sharing activities
        (sharing corrupt or empty files)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p>Since the impossibility to check the effective content of a Torrent
        before its complete download</p></li>
        <li><p>Since the impossibility to determine whether a copyrighted file
        (remember that Open Source programs are still copyrightes)
        can be freely distributed over Internet or not</p></li>
        <li><p>Since the impossibility to constantly monitor the Torrent available on the portal
        and to judge their content</p></li>
        <li><p>Since that *MYBT* does not host any Torrent, but they all are shared in a private form
        by their owners</p></li>
</ul>
<p>*MYBT* declines any responsibility regarding Torrent files' contents and
the use done by final users. But, the Staff is available, by written request sent
to the e-Mail address *EMAIL*, with full reason and details (and, in case of copyrighted material,
the name of the copyright owner) to &quot;ban&quot; a Torrent from the Tracker.
&quot;Banning&quot; consists in the impossibility, by users, to download a Torrent.
Differently from simple deletion, ban blocks future attempts to re-upload an illegal file .</p>
<p>The user accepts that:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p>There is an automated &quot;keyword&quot; filter that prevents users to upload illegal files.
        The filter is constantly updated by the Staff, but it is still subject to errors.
        In the case a good file is considered illegal by the system, we invite the user to rename it
        and accept our apologizes for the inconvenience.</p></li>
        <li><p>The above filter can, upon written request, sent via e-Mail to *EMAIL* and from exclusively the
        copyright owner or his/her legal representant, be updated by te Staff in order to block
        a copyrighted Torrent upload</p></li>
        <li><p>There is a &quot;log&quot;, not available to anybody, that keeps track of user actions
        in order only to prevent illegal activities such as pedophilia. The above log is kept
        with all most advanced security and cryptography measures by *MYBT*'s Privacy Administrator,
        and only the lines regarding an illegal Torrent may, upon written request, be shown to the
        Authorities, under law procedures</p></li>
