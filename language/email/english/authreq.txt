Subject: {SUB_JECT} 

Hi, {MASTER},
you are receiving this message because the user {SLAVE} requested to download Torrent {TOR_NAME} on {SITENAME}.

He won't be able to download it until you give him the authorization from your Personal Panel:
{TOR_URL}

Usually, you'll want to decide what to do considering the user's upload/download ratio.
You're also able to allow or deny him to download ALL the Torrents you will upload in one fell swoop, 
and you won't be bothered by these requests any more.
