Hi $gr_name,
we inform you that user $granter has decided to reset all your Torrent download Authorizations for the Torrents he or she owns.

Your old download permissions have now been restored. You will be still able to download the Torrents you were authorized for, 
but not those for which you weren't authorized. 
In order to download Torrents you never asked the authorization for, you have to send a new request.

Remember that the Torrent Owner may at any time change your authorizations.
You'll be sent a confirmation message at the event of any authorization change for this and for any Torrent you requested to download.

Regards,
$sitename Staff
