DEVELOPERS PLEASE NOTE

ALL Language Files MUST be Encoded in UTF-8 Without BOM.

Placeholders can now contain Order Information, e.g. instead of
'Page %s of %s' you can (and should) write 'Page %1$s of %2$s', this allows
Translators to Re-order the Output of Data while ensuring it remains correct

You DO NOT need this where Single Placeholders are used, e.g. 'Message %d' is fine
equally where a String contains Only Two Placeholders which are used to Wrap Text
in a URL you again DO NOT need to specify an Order e.g., 'Click %sHERE%s' is fine
